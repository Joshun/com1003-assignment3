\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{ Okay I think we need to be more clever about this. I think we need to create some layers. One layer to handle the frames. Because at the moment we have to create code to have flags so they only fire once when the state changes. So maybe have like a layer which just has two methods, updateState and performActionOnState. Because atm we have stuff they are handling both updating variables and the robot movement. E.g. the move robot method shouldnt really be called every frame like it is, it should only be called when it changes. If that makes sense :/ }{2}}
